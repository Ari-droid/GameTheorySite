      <h3 class="section-title">Sociological Relevance of Game Theory</h3>
      <p>While game theory is often associated with economics and strategy, it also offers profound insights into how individuals behave within communities. It allows sociologists to understand the mechanisms of cooperation, conflict, and self-interest in group dynamics.</p>

      <h3 class="section-title">The Prisoner’s Dilemma: A Social Mirror</h3>
      <img src="assets/img/Classic.gif" alt="Pixel art prisoners in dilemma" class="retro-img" />
      <p>The Prisoner's Dilemma illustrates how rational individuals might act in ways that are detrimental to the group. This model helps explain real-world issues like overfishing, pollution, and underfunded public services.</p>
      <p>Yunias Dao, a Planner of Fisheries Development at Republic University of India, writes: “From a sociological perspective, the prisoner’s dilemma explains how individuals within a community may choose to act against the collective interest… such as the overuse of public lands or fisheries.”</p>

      <h3 class="section-title">Self-Interest in Social Structures</h3>
      <img src="assets/img/5concepts.png" alt="Pixel art of a competitive workplace" class="retro-img" />
      <p>Game theory reveals a core sociological insight: humans often prioritize self-gain. In competitive environments like the workplace, individuals must interpret rivals’ strategies, protect their own interests, and manage complex social cues—all resembling a strategic game in motion.</p>

      <h2>The Battle of the Sexes: A Game of Coordination</h2>
      <p>This game models a couple deciding between two events—say, a football game or a concert. Each prefers a different activity but values being together more than going to their preferred event alone. The challenge lies in coordination, where multiple stable solutions exist, but each requires trust or communication to achieve.</p>

      <h2>Chicken: A Game of Risk and Strategy</h2>
      <p>In the game of Chicken, two drivers head toward each other on a collision course. Whoever swerves first loses; if neither swerves, both crash. The game illustrates brinkmanship and is used to model real-world standoffs, such as arms races or political showdowns. The key takeaway: extreme strategies can be dangerous.</p>

      <h3 class="section-title">Beyond Numbers: Behavior and Decision-Making</h3>
      <p>Though game theory is rooted in mathematics, it serves as a rich tool for examining behavior, norms, and motivations. It bridges quantitative reasoning with qualitative analysis, shedding light on why individuals may ignore social consequences in pursuit of individual goals.</p>
